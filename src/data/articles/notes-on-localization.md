Designing interfaces for more than one language is a gift. It forces you to slow down, question assumptions, and write with empathy.

##### Principles that keep me grounded

- Prefer language codes over regions when possible.
- Craft microcopy that respects cultural nuance.
- Keep URLs language-agnostic to simplify SEO.

##### Operational tips

Sync the content pipeline with your translators. I use a simple spreadsheet paired with git branches so contributors always see the latest copy.

```bash
git checkout -b translate-landing-zh
# Translate content in /src/data/articles
# open a pull request for review
```

##### Celebrate diversity

> Localization is not a checkbox. It is an ongoing dialogue with your community.

Plan periodic tone reviews and encourage feedback from native speakers.
