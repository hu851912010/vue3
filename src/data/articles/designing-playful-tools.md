Building a delightful tool means crafting a narrative arc for the user. The experience should begin with a gentle onboarding, crescendo in productivity, and end with a satisfying completion state.

### Hooks that welcome curious minds

- Friendly empty states with guidance.
- Contextual hints instead of heavy tutorials.
- Responsive interactions that reward exploration.

### Texture and motion matter

I sketch motion frames before writing any code. Even subtle hover feedback can make a dense interface approachable.

```css
.button-primary {
  background: linear-gradient(140deg, #3b82f6, #60a5fa);
  transition: transform 160ms ease;
}

.button-primary:hover {
  transform: translateY(-1px);
}
```

### Ship, learn, iterate

> The tool is never finished, but every release should feel complete.

Collect feedback, keep the codebase lean, and let data inform the roadmap.
